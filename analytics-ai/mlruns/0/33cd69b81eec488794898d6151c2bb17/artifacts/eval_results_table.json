{"columns":["inputs","ground_truth","outputs","token_count"],"data":[["How does useEffect() work?","The useEffect() hook tells React that your component needs to do something after render. React will remember the function you passed (we\u2019ll refer to it as our \u201ceffect\u201d), and call it later after performing the DOM updates.","The `useEffect()` hook in React allows developers to perform side effects in functional components, such as data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM. It runs after the component renders and can be configured to run on every render or conditionally based on dependencies provided in an array.",57],["What does the static keyword in a function mean?","Static members belongs to the class, rather than a specific instance. This means that only one instance of a static member exists, even if you create multiple objects of the class, or if you don't create any. It will be shared by all objects.","The `static` keyword in a function means that the variable retains its value between function calls and is initialized only once, rather than being re-initialized with each invocation of the function. It also limits the variable's scope to the function in which it is declared, making it inaccessible from outside the function.",60],["What does the 'finally' block in Python do?","'Finally' defines a block of code to run when the try... except...else block is final. The finally block will be executed no matter if the try block raises an error or not.","In Python, the 'finally' block is used in exception handling to define a block of code that will be executed no matter what, whether an exception was raised or not. This is useful for cleaning up resources, such as closing files or releasing locks, ensuring that specific cleanup actions occur regardless of the success or failure of the try block.",68],["What is the difference between multiprocessing and multithreading?","Multithreading refers to the ability of a processor to execute multiple threads concurrently, where each thread runs a process. Whereas multiprocessing refers to the ability of a system to run multiple processors in parallel, where each processor can run one or more threads.","Multiprocessing involves running multiple processes simultaneously, each with its own memory space, which allows for better isolation and utilization of multiple CPU cores. In contrast, multithreading involves multiple threads within the same process sharing memory space, leading to lighter resource usage but potential issues with data corruption and thread synchronization.",59]]}
