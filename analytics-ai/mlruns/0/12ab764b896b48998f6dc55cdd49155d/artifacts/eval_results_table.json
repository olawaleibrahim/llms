{"columns":["inputs","ground_truth","outputs","token_count"],"data":[["How does useEffect() work?","The useEffect() hook tells React that your component needs to do something after render. React will remember the function you passed (we\u2019ll refer to it as our \u201ceffect\u201d), and call it later after performing the DOM updates.","The `useEffect()` hook in React allows you to perform side effects in function components, such as data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM. It takes two arguments: a callback function that contains the side effect logic, and an optional dependency array that specifies when to re-run the effect based on changes to the listed dependencies.",67],["What does the static keyword in a function mean?","Static members belongs to the class, rather than a specific instance. This means that only one instance of a static member exists, even if you create multiple objects of the class, or if you don't create any. It will be shared by all objects.","The static keyword in a function indicates that the function retains its state between function calls, meaning it will remember the value of its variables across multiple invocations. Additionally, it restricts the visibility of the function to the file in which it is declared, preventing it from being accessed by other files in the program.",62],["What does the 'finally' block in Python do?","'Finally' defines a block of code to run when the try... except...else block is final. The finally block will be executed no matter if the try block raises an error or not.","The 'finally' block in Python is used in exception handling to define a block of code that will always execute, regardless of whether an exception was raised or not. It is typically used for cleanup actions, such as releasing resources or closing files, ensuring that these actions occur even if an error occurred in the try block.",64],["What is the difference between multiprocessing and multithreading?","Multithreading refers to the ability of a processor to execute multiple threads concurrently, where each thread runs a process. Whereas multiprocessing refers to the ability of a system to run multiple processors in parallel, where each processor can run one or more threads.","Multiprocessing involves the use of multiple processes, each with its own memory space, allowing for true parallelism on multi-core systems, while multithreading refers to the use of multiple threads within a single process that share the same memory space, which can lead to more efficient resource usage but may face challenges such as thread contention. Essentially, multiprocessing is beneficial for CPU-bound tasks, whereas multithreading is typically more effective for I\/O-bound tasks.",89]]}
