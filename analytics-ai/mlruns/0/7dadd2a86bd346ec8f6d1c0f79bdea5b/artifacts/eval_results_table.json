React will remember the function you passed (we\u2019ll refer to it as our \u201ceffect\u201d), and call it later after performing the DOM updates.","The `useEffect()` hook in React allows developers to perform side effects in function components, such as data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM. It takes a function as its first argument, which runs after the component renders, and an optional second argument\u2014an array of dependencies that determines when the effect should re-run based on changes to those dependencies.",71,4,"The language used in the response is formal and respectful, with no casual elements or slang. It is clear, concise, and appropriate for a business or academic setting. However, it is not excessively formal to the level of a textbook, hence the score is 4."],["What does the static keyword in a function mean?","Static members belongs to the class, rather than a specific instance. This means that only one instance of a static member exists, even if you create multiple objects of the class, or if you don't create any. It will be shared by all objects.","In a function, the `static` keyword means that the variable retains its value between function calls, allowing it to maintain state across invocations. Additionally, a static variable's scope is limited to the function it is defined in, meaning it cannot be accessed from outside that function.",56,4,"The language used in the response is formal and respectful, avoiding casual elements.

The finally block will be executed no matter if the try block raises an error or not.","The 'finally' block in Python is used in exception handling to define a section of code that will execute regardless of whether an exception occurs or not. It is typically placed after 'try' and 'except' blocks to ensure that certain cleanup actions, like closing files or releasing resources, are performed even if an error is encountered.",66,4,"The language used in the response is formal and respectful, providing a clear and concise explanation without the use of slang, colloquialisms, or overly casual language.

Whereas multiprocessing refers to the ability of a system to run multiple processors in parallel, where each processor can run one or more threads.","Multiprocessing involves running multiple processes simultaneously, each with its own memory space, which allows for true parallelism and is more effective for CPU-bound tasks. In contrast, multithreading involves running multiple threads within a single process, sharing the same memory space, making it more suitable for I\/O-bound tasks but potentially leading to issues like race conditions.",69,4,"The language used in the response is formal and respectful, providing a clear and concise explanation without the use of slang or colloquialisms.
