React will remember the function you passed (we\u2019ll refer to it as our \u201ceffect\u201d), and call it later after performing the DOM updates.","`useEffect()` is a React hook that allows you to perform side effects in functional components, such as data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM. It runs after the component renders and can be configured to run based on dependencies that you specify, allowing you to control when the effect should re-run.",62,4,"The language used in the response is formal and respectful, providing a clear and concise explanation without the use of slang or colloquialisms. It is appropriate for business or academic settings."],["What does the static keyword in a function mean?","Static members belongs to the class, rather than a specific instance. This means that only one instance of a static member exists, even if you create multiple objects of the class, or if you don't create any. It will be shared by all objects.","The `static` keyword in a function indicates that the variable's lifetime extends beyond the function call, retaining its value between invocations. It also restricts the variable's scope to the function in which it is defined, preventing access from other functions.",50,4,"The language used in the response is formal and respectful, avoiding casual elements.

However, it is not excessively formal to the level of a textbook, hence the score is 4."],["What does the 'finally' block in Python do?","'Finally' defines a block of code to run when the try... except...else block is final. The finally block will be executed no matter if the try block raises an error or not.","The 'finally' block in Python is used to define a section of code that will execute regardless of whether an exception was raised or not in the corresponding try block. It is commonly used for cleanup actions, such as closing files or releasing resources, ensuring that these actions occur even if an error occurs.",60,4,"The language used in the response is formal and respectful, providing a clear and concise explanation without the use of slang or colloquialisms.

Whereas multiprocessing refers to the ability of a system to run multiple processors in parallel, where each processor can run one or more threads.","Multiprocessing involves running multiple processes simultaneously, each with its own memory space, enabling better utilization of multiple CPU cores. In contrast, multithreading allows multiple threads to run within a single process, sharing the same memory space, which can lead to easier data sharing but also potential issues with thread safety.",60,4,"The language used in the response is formal and respectful, with no casual elements or slang.
